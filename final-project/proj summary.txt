The Meal Order System In Python is a simple project developed using Python. The project contains only the admin side. The admin side manages all the orders, 
payment process, bill report, and so on.

This project demonstrates a digital way to order different services be it food,drinks and few other services.
Starting off user will be prompted to select any desired operation from the following options:

---PAYMENT option will be used to make payment for any orders made by the user
---EXIT will be used to leave the interface.
